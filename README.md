# Stock Multi-Tab Researcher

**Stock Multi-Tab Researcher** is a simple yet efficient web-based tool designed to help investors and traders conduct quick stock research. Simply enter the stock exchange code and stock code and the tool will open multiple analysis tabs simultaneously, including news and financial statistics.

## ✨ Key Features

- **One-Click Analysis:** Opens various research sources in one click.
- **Smart URL Mapping:** Automatically converts exchange and ticker inputs into valid URLs, supporting cross-global capital market searches based on user input.
- **Anti-Blocking Mechanism:** Equipped with a timeout between tab openings to minimize pop-up blocking by browsers.
- **Manual Backup Links:** Provides a list of manual links in case the automatic feature is blocked by browser security settings.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean and modern interface, comfortable to use on various devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For content structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling with a card-based UI approach.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For URL processing logic and new window management.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open File:** Run this `.html` file in your preferred browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
2. **Enter Stock Code:** Enter the target stock exchange code (Example: `SSE` for China, `SGX` for the Singapore market).
3. **Enter Stock Code:** Enter the stock ticker you want to analyze (Example: `601398`, `700`, or `D05`).
4. **Click "Open All Tabs":** The browser will attempt to open 3 new tabs automatically.
5. **Check Pop-ups:** If the tab won't open, make sure you've allowed the "Pop-up Blocked" notification in your browser's address bar.

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Pop-up Issues:** Most modern browsers automatically block the `window.open` command. If this happens, simply click the link that appears in the **"Manual Links"** section of the app or change your browser settings to allow pop-ups from this site.
